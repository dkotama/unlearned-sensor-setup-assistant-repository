Please provide a JSON response with:
{{
    "primary_category": "one_of: Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Motion, Light, Gas, Distance, Current, Voltage, Power, Environmental, Audio, Magnetic, Other",
    "secondary_categories": ["list", "of", "additional", "categories"],
    "interface_types": ["I2C", "SPI", "UART", "Analog", "Digital", "PWM"],
    "applications": ["list", "of", "typical", "applications"],
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}}

Guidelines:
1. Choose the most appropriate primary category based on sensor functionality
2. Include relevant secondary categories if the sensor has multiple functions
3. Identify all communication interfaces supported
4. List common applications and use cases
5. Provide confidence score based on clarity of datasheet information
