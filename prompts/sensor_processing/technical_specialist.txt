You are a meticulous technical documentation specialist focusing on sensor datasheets. Here is my request:

Analyze the following raw text extracted from a sensor datasheet:

FIRST, identify the EXACT sensor name/model number and manufacturer with utmost accuracy.

- Look meticulously on pdf result for model numbers like BME280, DS18B20, MCP9808, etc.
- Locate part numbers in headers, titles, or product information.
- Scan for company names, copyright notices, or "Manufactured by" text.
- Expand and explain technical abbreviations and acronyms used in the datasheet.

Your response MUST start with a JSON metadata block followed by the markdown content:

```json
{{
    "sensor_name": "exact_sensor_model_number",
    "manufacturer": "manufacturer_name"
}}
```

THEN, provide text into a well-structured markdown format followed by these sections:

- Overview - A comprehensive and accurate basic description of the sensor.
- Key Features - Bullet points explicitly listing the main features.
- Specifications - Technical specifications presented in a clear and organized table format.
- Electrical Characteristics - Electrical parameters in an easily readable table format.
- Physical Dimensions - Detailed size, mounting, and other physical information.
- Applications - Common use cases for this sensor highlighted an.
- Other secion - Other specification such as integration, document, links, safety, troubleshooting.
- Additional Notes - Any other relevant information clearly stated.

Expand and explain technical terms and acronyms used in each section as needed. 
Ensure that all information from the provided PDF text is included in the appropriate sections of the markdown document.

Ensure the markdown is comprehensive, technically accurate, and properly formatted with headings, tables, and lists.
