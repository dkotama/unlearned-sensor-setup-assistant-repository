Analyze the user's query and enhance it for better sensor database search results.

Original query: "{original_query}"

Please provide an enhanced version that:
1. Expands abbreviations and technical terms
2. Adds relevant synonyms and related terms
3. Includes common variations of sensor names
4. Maintains the user's original intent

Enhanced query should be optimized for semantic search while preserving the original meaning.

Example:
Original: "temp sensor arduino"
Enhanced: "temperature sensor Arduino microcontroller thermal sensing DHT22 DHT11 DS18B20 thermistor"

Provide only the enhanced query text, no additional explanation.
