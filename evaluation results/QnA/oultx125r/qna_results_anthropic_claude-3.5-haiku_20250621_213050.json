      "model_answer": "Based on the provided sensor information, there are no specific details about interference types that should be avoided. However, the environmental specifications suggest avoiding condensing humidity, as the sensor is rated for non-condensing humidity levels between 10-90% RH. Additionally, since it has an IP20 rating (indoor use), environmental factors like moisture, dust, or extreme temperature variations outside its -20°C to +60°C operating range could potentially impact reading stability.",
      "is_correct": false,
      "evaluation_explanation": "The model answer does not mention EMI sources, which are specified in the expected answer as the type of interference to avoid for stable readings. Instead, it focuses on environmental conditions like humidity and temperature, which do not address the expected answer directly.",
